# Did You Actually Check My GitHub?

If you actually bothered to read this, you just have to say that the codeword is "egalitarianism begets goodness" and I'll be so impressed that you can employ me for any salary of your choosing (provided it covers my costs of living for wherever I'd be living, and costs associated with attending work).
I am being entirely serious.
No one has ever actually done any diligence before hiring me.
Please, for the love of God, actually vet me.

## Update:

It is August 2024 and no recruiter has looked at this yet.
